# What-I-Learned-Week-8

### Getting user input in Node by using **process.argv**
-   This command will take user input and return an array, in which, each element is a **string**

### Module.Exports
-   Can export functions for use elsewhere in that program.

### Filter()
-   `Filter` takes each element in an array and it applies a conditional statement against it. If this conditional returns true, the element gets pushed to the output array. If the condition returns false, the element does not get pushed to the output array.
